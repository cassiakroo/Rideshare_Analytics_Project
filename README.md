# Rideshare Database Project

**Goal:** Build a relational rideshare database and perform SQL and Python analytics to demonstrate data engineering and querying skills.

**Data Source:** `rideshare.db` — a SQLite database containing trips, drivers, and zones tables.

**How to Run:**  
Open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio and click **Knit** to generate the report.  
Make sure the `rideshare.db` file is in your working directory.

**Folder Map:**  
`data/` – raw & sample CSVs  
`sql/` – query scripts (exploration → windows → interview practice)  
`python/` – Jupyter notebooks for profiling, EDA, and time series analysis  
`reports/` – summary and visuals for presentation
