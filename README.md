# Rideshare Data Exploration

### Overview  
This project explores real-world rideshare data (based on the **Hubway bike-share system**) using **SQL** and **Python**.  
The analysis focuses on uncovering key ridership patterns, temporal trends, and user behaviors to inform operational insights such as station balancing, seasonal demand, and user segmentation.

---

### Objectives  
- Analyze trip volume and growth over time  
- Identify hourly and weekday commuting patterns  
- Explore seasonal variation in ride duration  
- Evaluate station activity and directional flow imbalance  
- Compare casual vs. registered rider behavior  
- Detect outliers and usage anomalies  

---

### Tools & Skills  
- **SQL (SQLite3)** – Joins, CTEs, subqueries, window functions  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** – Data manipulation, visualization, and automation  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Reproducible exploratory analysis  
- **EDA Workflow** – Query design, data cleaning, interpretation  

---

### Key Findings  
- Strong weekday commuter peaks around **8 AM** and **5 PM**  
- Seasonal variation with longer rides in **summer months**  
- Central hubs like **South Station** dominate trip activity  
- Directional imbalances highlight the need for **bike rebalancing**  
- **Registered users** ride more frequently and consistently, while **casual users** take longer leisure trips  
- A small portion of trips form **extreme outliers**, likely due to stalled rides or data recording issues  

---

### Future Work  
- Incorporate **weather or time-of-day** data for predictive modeling  
- Build **interactive dashboards** for monitoring ridership and station balance  
- Extend to **machine learning** for trip duration and demand forecasting
